      <description>Since the goal of this work was to study the temperatures fluctuations over time, we needed long temperatures time series, possibly for more than one weather station.
We found a great solution in the data collected by Sigmund H. Moen, co-author of this paper and creator of the web page www.rimfrost.no, where most of the record are freely available. The data consist in a big amount of temperatures time series, certified by NASA, for more than 100 countries, giving a total of 1258 weather stations; the time series are available as yearly, monthly and even three-times-a-day observations, and the length of the time series may vary greatly from station to station: while some of them are less than ten years long, the longer time series, from the city of Upssala in Sweden, is 290 years long, with monthly data from 1722 to 2012, at the time were the data were collected.</description>
