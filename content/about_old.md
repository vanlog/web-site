<div class="lead heading text-center"">

We are a senior AI product studio.<br>
We help teams turn applied AI research into reliable, production-ready systems.

## Why we exist

Bulding AI products is deceptively easy. Making them work in production, scale over time, and be trusted by users is not.
We started Vanlog to bridge the gap between AI research, product design, and real-world constraints — data quality, evaluation, costs, and long-term maintenance.

## How we work


<div class="about-howwework-box">

1. **Understand the problem**<br>
	*We start from the use case, not from the model.* Constraints, users, risks, data availability.

1. **Measure before building**<br>
    *Baselines, evaluations, and benchmarks come first.* If we can’t measure it, we don’t ship it.

2. **Build for production**<br>
    *Monitoring, logging, fallbacks, guardrails.* No demos that break after launch.

3. **Iterate with evidence**<br>
    *Improve quality, latency, and costs using real data.* Decisions are driven by metrics, not hype.

4. **Transfer ownership**<br>
    *Clear documentation, walkthroughs, and training.* Teams are never left with a black box.

## Founder

*Hi, I’m Andrea Melloncelli.*

*I work at the intersection of applied AI, product engineering, and research.*

*With 15+ years of experience, I’ve led teams and projects in AI, data science, and software engineering, focusing on turning research into robust, production-ready products. My background spans LLM applications, information retrieval, evaluation frameworks, and agentic systems, with a strong emphasis on reliability and measurable impact.
I founded Vanlog to bring research rigor and real-world pragmatism to AI product development.
