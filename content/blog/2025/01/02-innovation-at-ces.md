## CES 2026: Exploring the Next Wave of Intelligence

The doors of CES 2026 have opened, and the world’s attention is once again on Las Vegas. This year, the event is not just a showcase of the latest gadgets, but a living laboratory for the future of intelligence—both artificial and physical—embedded in devices that shape our daily lives and professional environments.

Our team is on the ground to investigate how innovation is evolving, with a particular focus on the intersection of AI, quantum computing, and robotics. The goal: to understand how these technologies are being planned and integrated into the next generation of consumer and professional devices.

### Why CES 2026 Matters

CES has always been a barometer for technology trends, but this year’s event stands out for its emphasis on intelligence that is not just digital, but physical. AI is moving beyond the cloud and into the hardware itself, enabling smarter, more adaptive devices. Quantum computing, once a distant promise, is now being discussed as a near-term enabler for breakthroughs in optimization, security, and simulation. Robotics is no longer confined to industrial settings—physical AI is making its way into homes, workplaces, and public spaces, with hardware-in-the-loop systems that blur the line between software and the real world.

### What We’re Looking For

We’re here to observe how leading companies and startups are approaching:

- **AI on Devices:** How artificial intelligence is being embedded directly into consumer electronics and professional tools, enabling real-time decision-making and personalization.
- **Quantum-Ready Hardware:** Early demonstrations and roadmaps for quantum-enabled devices, and how they might accelerate innovation in fields from healthcare to logistics.
- **Physical AI & Robotics:** The rise of robots and intelligent machines that interact with the physical world, and the new opportunities and challenges they bring.

### The Importance of Physical Intelligence

As AI becomes tangible—moving from algorithms to actuators—the implications for society, business, and daily life are profound. Hardware-in-the-loop approaches are enabling safer, more reliable systems, and the convergence of AI and robotics is opening new frontiers in automation, mobility, and human-machine collaboration.

### Our Perspective

Attending CES 2026 is not just about witnessing product launches; it’s about understanding the direction of innovation and the real-world impact of emerging technologies. By being present, we aim to capture insights that will inform our work and help us anticipate the next wave of transformation in both consumer and professional domains.

Stay tuned as we share our findings and reflections from the show floor, highlighting the most promising developments and the questions they raise for the future of intelligent devices.
