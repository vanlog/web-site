## About Vanlog

We are a senior AI product studio.<br>
We help teams turn applied AI research into reliable, production-ready systems.

---

## Why we exist

Bulding AI products is deceptively easy. Making them work in production, scale over time, and be trusted by users is not.
We started Vanlog to bridge the gap between AI research, product design, and real-world constraints, data quality, evaluation, costs, and long-term maintenance.

*Hi, I’m Andrea Melloncelli.*

*I take AI from breakthrough to business impact.*

*For over 10 years, I've been the bridge between what's cutting-edge and what actually ships. Leading teams across AI, data science, and product engineering, I specialize in turning emerging capabilities—Deep Learning, LLMs, agentic systems—into production-grade solutions that scale. My track record: combining technical rigor in Statistics and Mathematical Models with commercial discipline to deliver AI that's both innovative and reliable. The result? Products that don't just impress—they perform and drive measurable ROI.* <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-melloncelli/" target="_blank" style="display:inline-flex;align-items:center;gap:0.4em;">
