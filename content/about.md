## About Vanlog

We are a senior AI product studio.<br>
We help teams turn applied AI research into reliable, production-ready systems.

---

## Why we exist

Bulding AI products is deceptively easy. Making them work in production, scale over time, and be trusted by users is not.
We started Vanlog to bridge the gap between AI research, product design, and real-world constraints, data quality, evaluation, costs, and long-term maintenance.

*Hi, I’m Andrea Melloncelli.*

*I work at the intersection of applied AI, product engineering, and research.*

*With 10+ years of experience, I’ve led teams and projects in AI, data science, and software engineering, focusing on turning research into robust, production-ready products.
