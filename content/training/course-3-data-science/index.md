## Description

This course is an introduction to Machine Learning and Optimization with Python. The course starts defining mathematical modelling and how it can be used in real business cases. Examples of supervised and unsupervised learning are provided with a presentation of the main methodologies to train performant models. Then the course completes the picture with a deep dive into time series analysis and optimization problems. The course is designed to be interactive and practical. The student will learn by doing, by solving real business problems.
