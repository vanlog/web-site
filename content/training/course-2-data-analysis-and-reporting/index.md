## Description

This course is designed to introduce you to the world of data analysis and reporting with Python. The first approach with the data must be to read it, clean it, and understand its content. Finally, after a numerical and graphical analysis, communicate results through beautiful presentations and reports. This is exactly what this course is about.

The course covers the basics of Python, the main libraries for data analysis, and how to create reports and visualizations. The course is designed to be interactive and practical. The student will learn by doing, by solving real business problems.


## Topics include

1. Origins and key features of Python
2. Editors and platforms: what's available and how to choose
3. Installing and configuring the Python environment with Anaconda
4. Visual Studio, Jupyter, JupyterLab
5. Virtual environment: what it is, what it's used for, and how to configure it
6. Introduction to Git, GitHub, and GitLab
7. Introduction to data analysis
8. Introduction to major Python libraries for data analysis: NumPy and Pandas
9. What is vectorial programming and how it improves readability and performance
10. NumPy arrays: what they are, why they are useful, and key features
11. Vector and Matrix operations
12. Tensor operations
13. Practical examples of using NumPy
14. Introduction to Pandas
15. Pandas: subsetting, selecting, filtering, sorting, unique values, aggregations, basic statistics
16. Reading and writing data: text files, Excel, database connections, JSON, XML
17. Data preparation and cleaning: handling missing data, replacing values, normalization, deduplication, permutations, random sampling, identifying and removing outliers, computing indicators and dummy variables, discretization
18. Working with datasets: reshaping, merging, joining, summary statistics
19. Introduction to Plotnine
20. Creating basic charts with Plotnine
21. Customizing charts with Plotnine
22. Data aggregation and group analysis
23. Working with dates and timelines
24. Introduction to the Plotly library: creating interactive visualizations in the browser
25. Export Jupiter Notebooks into beautiful reports
